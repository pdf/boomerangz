# Day-to-day operation

## Check the service

::: code-group

```sh [Linux / systemd]
systemctl status boomerangz.service
journalctl -u boomerangz.service
```

:::

The daemon logs to the system journal when run by systemd.

## View status

Show one current status snapshot:

```sh
boomerangz status
```

In a terminal, status is formatted for reading. Redirected output is one JSON
object. Watch continuously:

```sh
boomerangz status --watch
boomerangz status --watch --interval 5s
```

When watch output is redirected, it becomes newline-delimited JSON.

## Request a snapshot

Queue an immediate snapshot for every active root:

```sh
boomerangz trigger
```

Or name one or more active scheduling roots:

```sh
boomerangz trigger tank/data tank/home
```

A trigger uses the normal queue and safety checks. It does not duplicate work
that is already queued or running.

## Confirm that protection is current

Use all three views:

1. `boomerangz status` to confirm the daemon and recent work;
2. `boomerangz dataset inspect DATASET` to confirm the effective policy;
3. `zfs list -t snapshot -r DATASET` on the source and `zfs list -r ROOT` on
   each destination to confirm the stored data.

For remote destinations, confirm both the most recent successful transfer and
the destination dataset itself. A successful source snapshot alone does not
prove that an independent copy exists.

## Apply configuration changes

After editing configuration files, apply them without interrupting active work:

```sh
boomerangz config reload
```

The JSON result identifies fields applied live and any `restart_required`
fields retained from the previous configuration. An invalid or otherwise
unusable candidate leaves the running configuration unchanged. See
[Configure the daemon](/guide/configuration#validate-changes) for the reload
contract and non-default socket usage.

Only restart the service when the reload result requires it, such as after
changing `paths.identity_dir`, or when performing planned maintenance. Stopping
the daemon prevents new work and cancels active transfers; recoverable transfer
state is retained so work can continue after restart.

## Monitor storage

Review source snapshots and destination usage regularly:

```sh
zfs list -o name,used,available,refer,mountpoint
zfs list -t snapshot -o name,used,refer,creation -s creation
```

Retention limits snapshot history, but snapshots can remain because another ZFS
object or an incomplete replication still depends on them. Investigate rather
than deleting unfamiliar state manually.
